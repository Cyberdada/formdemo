# Formdemo

This is a demoproject that tries to illustrate how to build complex frankenforms with the 
help of angular reactive forms. 

The project also makes use of Angular Material, and shows how to do clientside 
image manipulation before posting image to server

Project is currently unstable, hopefully ready soon :)
